## 🧩 Message Types

Each outreach sequence generally consists of:

1. **Connection Request** – With or without a note
2. **Welcome Message** – Sent after connecting
3. **Job Introduction** – Explains the opportunity
4. **Follow-Up** – Nudges if no reply
5. **Final Message** – Friendly close-off

Placeholders like `{{FirstName}}`, `{{JobTitle}}`, and `{{CompanyName}}` can be used to personalize messages.
